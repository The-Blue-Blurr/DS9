# DS9
All the configs &amp; files I write for my personal server, simply codenamed DS9.

# To-Do

## General Stuff
- [ ] get website name to redirect to server IP
- [ ] setup reverse proxy (I think I have to do this?)
- [ ] get analytics running (maybe use Grafana?)
- [ ] get dashboard up and running maybe (casaOS style?)
- [ ] make master compose.yaml file that includes all other *.yaml files I want to startup

## Braveridge (Minecraft)
- [ ] get basic MC server running (https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (need to figure out if I should use paper or pufferfish (https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish))
- [ ] get 3d map working (maybe this one? (https://hub.docker.com/r/marctv/minecraft-overviewer))
- [ ] get minecraft dashboard running (https://mcsmanager.com) (https://docs.mcsmanager.com/docker-install.html)

## Website(???)
- [ ] basic welcome page set up
- [ ] pages for different things (e.g. nextcloud, braveridge info, etc.)
